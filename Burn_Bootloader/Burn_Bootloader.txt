To burn the bootloader:

Obtain an AVR ISP, USBtinyISP, ParallelProgrammer, or similar; or use another Arduino board. This will be your ISP.
Unless otherwise instructed, connect the ISP to the ICSP pins on your board.
Power your board with either a USB cable or an external power supply.
Open up the Arduino IDE.
Make sure you selected the correct board that you are burning to at Tools ► Board ► in the IDE. Double-check this even if you could upload programs correctly; uploading doesn't always require the right board.
Select the appropriate programmer at Tools ► Programmer ►.
Click Tools ► Burn Bootloader, and wait. It shouldn't take more than a minute, and often takes only a few seconds.
